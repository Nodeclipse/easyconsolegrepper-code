Easy Console Grepper 
  Copyright (c) 2013 Jens Pfahl


Features:
 * Filter fixed strings or RegExp matches from any TextConsoles
 * Highlighting of all matches
 * Show subsequent lines after matched lines
 * Store filter settings for each GrepConsole
 * Resume filtering after a console has been disposed and is started again (beta state, works fine for Java Consoles) 
 * Re-filter on demand
 * Show marked line numbers since line number difference is greater than one
 * Store SearchStrings also when Eclipse is restarted (right click to "Containing Text"-Label clears the list)
